# Tavernpunk Unity3d Helpers

A one file script where I put all my cross-project helper functions for Unity3d C# projects.

Purpose:

- one file
- no dependencies
- cross platform

Maybe someday, far into the future, I will document each of them, but for now it's just a dump ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

### Usage

Simply drop into a Unity3d assets folder.
